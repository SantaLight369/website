      What is a challenge you came across in TSA?: 
      
      Figuring out what project you 
      wanna do and who you want to work with because when you decide what project
      you have to continue it and you can't choose something else. 
      
      How the TSA community has been helpful to you?:
      
      I think it helped me by giving me a club to do during my high school
      year and just like be a part of something.
      
      What are some strengths our community has?: 
      
      I think one of our biggest strengths is 
      helping each other out with like projects because you can always 
      go to your upperclassmen if you need help with what you need to do 
      for it.

      What are some strengths our community has?: 
      
      We have a really supporting community and everybody is so willing to
      help others, especially in events they did the year before. Even at 
      conferences, everyone is clapping for each other or just whenever 
      they see our school's name up on the board.
      
      How has TSA helped you?: 
      
      TSA really taught me how to keep up with deadlines and to forego 
      procrastination. It also encourages going beyond the rubric because 
      the better the work you do, a higher result is what you
      will receive.

      What are some strengths our community has?:
      
      Our TSA clubs shows a lot of intellectual diversity which helps us 
      move with the times. Since everyone is at a different point in life 
      we are able to learn more things. We are able to find an equal
      balance which shows that our community is healthy. 
      
      What is a challenge you came across in TSA?:
      
      Being the new student, as the new student I did not really have a
      mentor to guide me or tell me what to do in TSA, but with the help 
      of my peers and some adults I was able to find what I was passionate
      about.

      How has TSA provided life skills?: 
      
      TSA taught me not to procastinate 
      and do my work on time. Like last year when we did children stories
      it was really hectic because we did not have a lot of planning. Time 
      management is important.
      
      Favorite TSA memory?: 
      
      States last year because we had so much fun 
      competing and meeting new people. 
      
      What are some strengths our community has?: 
      
      One of our strengths as a community is always rooting for each other 
      and being there for one another.
