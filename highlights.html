      Hardest challenge in TSA: Figuring out what project you wanna do 
      and who you want to work with because when you decide what project
      you have to continue it and you can't choose something else. 
      How the TSA community has been helpful: I think it helped me by 
      giving me a club to do during my highschool year and just like be a 
      part of something.
      One of TSA's strengths: I think one of our biggest strengths is 
      helping each other out with like projects because you can always 
      go to your upperclassmen if you need help with what you need to do 
      for it.

      How the TSA community has been helpful: We have a really supporting 
      communityand everybody is so willing to help others, especially in events 
      they did the year before. Even at conferences, everyone is clapping for 
      each other or just whenever they see our school's name up on the board.
      How has TSA helped you: TSA really taught me how to keep up with 
      deadlines and to forego procrastination. It also encourages going beyond 
      the rubric because the better the work you do, a higher result is what you
      will recieve.

      How our TSA club portrays community: Our TSA clubs shows a lot of 
      intellectual diversity which helps us move with the times. Since everyone 
      is at a different point in life we are able to learn more things. We are
      able to find a equal balance which shows that our community is healthy. 
      Hardest challenge in TSA: Being the new student, as the new student I did
      not really have a mentor to guide me or tell me what to do in TSA, 
      but with the help of my peers and some adults I was able to find what 
      I was passionate about. Strenghts as a community: We are diverse in 
      age and skills, and this allows us to adress several topics.

      How has TSA provided life skills: TSA taught me not to procastinate 
      and do my work on time. Like last year when we did children stories
      it was really hectic because we did not have a lot of planning. Time 
      management is important.
      Favorite TSA memory: States last year because we had so much fun 
      competeing and meeting new people. 
      One of TSA's strengths: One of our strenghts as a community is always 
      rooting for each other and being there for one another.
