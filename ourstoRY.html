    <p>The Technology Student Association was started at South Fayette high school approximately 30 years ago. The current faculty sponsor, Mr. Hausman, took over the club in the 2017-2018 school year. The club was a lot smaller with 11 members, from which 3 competed in nationals. Over the years more and more people would join. </p>
