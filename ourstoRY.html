      The Technology Student Association was started at South Fayette High School 
      approximately 30 years ago. The current faculty sponsor, Mr. Hausman, took over 
      the club in the 2017–2018 school year. The club was a lot smaller with 11 members, 
      from which 3 competed in nationals. Over the years, more and more people joined.
