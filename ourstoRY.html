    <p>The Technology Student Association was started at South Fayette high school approximatly 30 years ago. Our current faculty sponser, Mr. Hausman, took over the club in the 2017-2018 school year. The club was a lot smaller with 11 members, in which 3 made it to nationals. Over the years more and more people have joined.</p>
